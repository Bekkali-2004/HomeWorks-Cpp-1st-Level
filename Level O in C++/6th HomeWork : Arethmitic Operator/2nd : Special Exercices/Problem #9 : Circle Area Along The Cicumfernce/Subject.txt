1st Task : Write A Program To Calculate Circle Area Along The Circumfernce
2nd Task : Then Print it on The Screen
    Example -> Math :> CircleArea = (L * L) / (4 * PI)
        Input -> L = 10 , PI = 3.14
        Output -> 7.961783439


(Don't Look This Code Before Finish Ur Program !)

And Finally Any Way For Write Ur Code is Right Way For Learning C++,
 But Only One Codition is The Output is Same in This Subject !
