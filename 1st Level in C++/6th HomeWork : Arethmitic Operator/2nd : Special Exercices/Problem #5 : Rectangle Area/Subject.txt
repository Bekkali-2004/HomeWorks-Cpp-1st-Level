1st Task : Write The Program To Calculate Rectangle Area.  
2nd Task : Print it on The Screen.
    Example -> 10 / 20 
            -> (Math Time Yay !!) -> Area Rectangle is : A * B = Area mPow2
            -> 10 * 20 = 200 mPow2


(Don't Look This Code Before Finish Ur Program !)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
And Finally Any Way For Write Ur Code is Right Way For Learning C++,
 But Only One Codition is The Output is Same in This Subject !
